# LookerTawkTo
Google Data Studio / Looker Studio Data Source to pull stats from the tawk.to chat bot.

Google Apps Script.

WARNING: This is a beta-beta version, quickly thrown together by someone (me) who hasn't really been coding for decades. Some assembly may be required. Plus you need to get an API key from tawk.to, which sometimes can be a bit...

But hey, it kinda works. For me atleast. So I thought I would share it. No support offered.

API Interfaces currently implemented:
 metrics.chats
 metrics.tickets-new
 metrics.tickets-reopened
 metrics.tickets-resolved
 metrics.tickets-responses
 chat.list
